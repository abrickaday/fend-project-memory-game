## Instructions
The objective of this Memory Game is to find all 8 matching pairs of cards.

A stopwatch keeps track of the time elapsed since the start of the game and a moves counter keeps track of the number of moves taken.

At the start of the game, the player starts with a full rating of 3 stars. The rating will drop when the number of moves taken increases.

When all card pairs are found, a winning modal shows the winning statistics.
